Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of insights from the skill column for the top 10 data engineer jobs in 2023:

ðŸ§  Most In-Demand Skills
| Rank | Skill                                                                       | Mentions |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1    | **Python**                                                                  | 7        |
| 2    | **Spark**                                                                   | 5        |
| 3    | **Hadoop**, **Kafka**, **Scala**                                            | 3 each   |
| 4    | **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **PySpark**, **Kubernetes**, **SQL**, **Databricks** | 2 each   |

ðŸš€ Key Insights

1. Python dominates â€” itâ€™s the universal glue for data engineering, analytics, and ML.
2. Big Data stack is essential â€” Spark, Hadoop, and Kafka form the backbone for handling large-scale data pipelines.
3. DataFrame tools (Pandas, NumPy, PySpark) â€” still highly relevant, especially in ETL and preprocessing workflows.
4. Cloud & DevOps integration â€” tools like Kubernetes, Databricks, and AWS/GCP/Azure show the growing blend between data engineering and infrastructure automation.
5. SQL remains a constant â€” even in 2023, structured data querying is a must-have.
6. Emerging crossover skills â€” PyTorch, Keras, and R appear in some listings, reflecting hybrid data engineer / ML engineer roles.
